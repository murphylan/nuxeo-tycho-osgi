Friendly fork of a subset of the nuxeo sources.
Each nuxeo module will be developped as an eclipse PDE project.
It will be built with maven-tycho
We are trying to see how things look like using those technologies and will demo this setup to the nuxeo community if they are interested.

The initial milestone consists of supporting nuxeo's webapp extension with jetty.
We will commit a jetty-7 adapter as nuxeo's current jetty adapter is using jetty-6.
The jetty-7 adapter will take advantage of jetty-osgi.
